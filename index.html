                            <p>
                                In our technology-driven world,
                                it takes more than good ideas to be successful.
                                Uber, for example, didn’t need to invent a new technology to build its business.
                                The company just took advantage of the explosion of smartphones and mobile applications
                                to design a compelling customer experience and invent a new way of doing business.
                                But this isn’t just about Uber being able to execute a good idea.
                                It’s also about the inability of the cab industry to act quickly to transform its own
                                business models to compete. Did they have time to respond to the market disruption that
                                Uber represents? Absolutely. But they needed an IT infrastructure that would allow them
                                to pivot when the inevitable disruption arrived and they didn’t have that.
                                The lesson here is: Whether you are a Fortune 50 or 1000 company,
                                everyone is at risk of missing a market opportunity, not securing their enterprise,
                                and being disrupted by a new idea or business model.

                               Success today is defined by the ability to turn ideas into value
                                faster than your competition, how quickly you can experiment,
                                fail fast, learn fast, test, tune and make it better.
                                The behavior of developers is to make changes and enhance the
                                application to generate revenue streams. Operations, on the
                                other hand, is all about stability and reliability to keep
                                business running 24/7. So how can you reconcile these two
                                conflicting views and reduce friction between the teams?
                                Enter DevOps.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                DevOps is not a technology but it is a process and a mindset
                                change to promote collaboration between Dev and Ops teams.
                                According to research from Puppet Labs, IT organizations embracing
                                DevOps deploy 200x more frequently, have 24x faster recovery times,
                                3x lower failure rates and spend 22% less time on unplanned work and
                                rework. This is not a coincidence because these organizations have
                                implemented a process of Continuous Integration and
                                Continuous Deployment (CI and CD) where every step of the application
                                lifecycle from development to deployment is automated with feedback loops
                                for continuous improvement.

                            <p>
                                Today, developers expect same level of efficiency, ease of access
                                and disposal of infrastructure similar to hyperscale cloud environments.
                                Therefore, every part of the infrastructure should be composable and
                                accessible as a line of code. With HPE OneView, you can automate entire
                                “Infrastructure-as-code” using your favorite configuration management
                                tools such as Chef, Puppet or Ansible and deploy IT resources for any
                                workload easily within few minutes, a task that used to take several days
                                to weeks to deploy. A great example of Composable Infrastructure is
                                HPE Synergy which includes HPE 3PAR StoreServ flash storage and
                                software-defined storage StoreVirtual VSA as storage building blocks.
                                The RESTful APIs from Storage platform are then exposed to automation tools
                                via HPE OneView for storage provisioning, management etc.
