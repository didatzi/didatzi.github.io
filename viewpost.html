                        <h1>Using Science to be a Winner: From Bingo to Monopoly</h1>

                        Let’s face facts, none of us enjoy losing. Whether you are prone to flipping the board during a
                        game of chess or known to lose your cool after becoming bankrupt when playing monopoly, we all
                        have a secret desire to win and be successful no matter what we attempt in life. There is a
                        difference between wanting to win and knowing how to, however, as while the former is driven by
                        ambition the latter requires skill, strategy and an eye for details. Interestingly, science can
                        play a pivotal role in enabling you to win almost every conceivable form of game, from classic
                        casino disciplines to your favourite board games.

                    <h3>Numeracy and Strategy: The Importance of Science and Mathematics</h3>
                    <div>
                        Let’s take Monopoly as an example, as first glance this would seem like the last game that could
                        be mastered using a scientific approach and fundamental mathematical principles. To the majority
                        of players, the Monopoly Board is viewed as an infinite loop, where chance and the roll of the dice
                        determines exactly where you land. While there is some truth to this, Business Insider reporter
                        Walter Hickey claims that players are far more likely to land on some spaces on others and this
                        should form the basis of their strategy. So instead of targeting the highest value properties,
                        players should invest in those that experience the most traffic.
                        So which properties are these? Essentially, they are on the squares located between the Jail and
                        Go to Jail, and this assumption works on basic probability and mathematics. After all, the jail
                        is known to suck in players from all over the board, through the Go to Jail Square, Chance cards
                        and Community Chest, and over the course of the game you are likely to spend several stints
                        behind bars. This instantly makes the properties beyond this point more viable and potentially
                        lucrative to players with a desire to win.
